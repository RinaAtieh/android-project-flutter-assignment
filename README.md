dry questions:

1- the class is snappingSheetController, it allows the developer to control the sheet and get
current snap position.

2- using snap positions class we can snap into position with various different animation, the
parameter that control this behaviour: positionPixel, snappingCurve, snappingDuration,
positionFactor, etc.

3- a- InkWell include ripple effect tap which GestureDetector doesn't.
   b- GestureDetector provides more controls like dragging.
